NIR spectra collected along the glue-laminated timber production.

The raw NIR spectra were collected by means of MicroNIR spectrometer (Viavi) on wooden boards used for the 
preparation of delamination samples. The reference data were collected with available alternative to NIR methods. 

All technical details are described in the manuscript "Feasibility of portable NIR spectrometer for quality 
assurance in glue-laminated timber production".
